# DevOps Project - 2022: CI/CD with Jenkins Ansible Kubernetes

This is my notes of udemy course [DevOps Project - 2022: CI/CD with Jenkins Ansible Kubernetes](https://www.udemy.com/course/valaxy-devops/)

- What you'll learn
    - Complete understanding of DevOps flow.
    - Kubernetes setup on AWS cloud
    - Setup DevOps CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy a real-time project

In this course, I have created a complete CI/CD pipeline to run a java application. 

In this learning journey, you have introduced tools like Github, Jenkins, maven, docker, ansible, and Kubernetes and 

learned how to integrate these tools to run a project in the real world.
